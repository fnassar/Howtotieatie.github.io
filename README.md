### How to Tie a Tie

### Description
'How to Tie a Tie' is a three-part video series that explores toxic masculinity through the metaphor of tying a tie. The actual procedure of tying the tie is interspersed with a narration/visuals that explore various aspects of supposed "manliness" and its associated social expectations. After each step that explains how to tie the tie, a screen appears prompting the user to repeat the motion that was last shown. 

The experience we strove to create was that of a "sarcastic yet not sarcastic" (in Fatema's words) take on toxic masculinity. We wanted to incorporate as many elements that would hint at a traditional masculine feel: black and white colors, vintage-looking fonts that appear on men's shaving cream logos, and the clean, sharp, straight lines in our layout. No female/female-identifying individual appears anywhere throughout the project -- even the photo album is filled with men.

### Process
After we had decided we wanted to create a how-to series, 
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
